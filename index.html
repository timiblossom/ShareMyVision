        <h3>Welcome to SMV project.</h3>

<p>Instragram like server component project.  It has a web component written in Jruby.
It has several separatedly deployable server components: user provision, mobile API, file upload/download, image processing service, email service, etc.
The whole thing is an SOA.</p>

<h3>Web component</h3>

<p>Using Rails and Jruby to display users' uploaded images</p>

<h3>Driver/aggregator compenent</h3>

<p>This is the heart of this SOA.  This is where Mobiles and Web components send API requests.
This is a stateless component which makes calls (sync/async) to other internal services.</p>

<h3>File Service</h3>

<p>A wrapper over S3 to serve file upload/download and generating encrypted, short-time-to-live urls</p>

<h3>Image processing</h3>

<p>Generate thumbnails and other sizes for an image</p>

<h3>Email Service</h3>

<p>Use to email out different emails with different templates</p>

<h3>Mobile API</h3>

<p>Written in Jruby with an aggregator component to split out a request into several internal requests and merge the results before returning to the mobile clients</p>

<h3>Catalog Service</h3>

<p>Light component to manage product catalog</p>
